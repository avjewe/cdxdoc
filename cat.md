### Header Mode
The header mode dictates what file headers are expected, and what to do when files don't match each other
 * Match -- First file can be anything, all other files must match the first one. This is the default.
 * Require -- All files must have identical CDX headers
 * Strip -- Strip CDX headers if present
 * None -- The presence of a CDX header is an error
 * Trust -- Strip CDX headers from all but first file. Trust that the data is compatible.
 * Ignore -- Treat CDX Headers just like any other line of data

### Pad Mode
What to do if files don't end with a newline
 * Yes - Always append a newline if one isn't present.  This is the default.
 * No - Never append a newline.
 * End - Appen a newline to the last file, if necessary.
