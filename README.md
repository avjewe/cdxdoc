# Documentation for the rust cdx package.

The cdx application is something like the gnu textutils, with added benefits :

* Written in Rust
* Generally faster, and better at dealing with enormous files
* Supports [Named Columns](NamedColumns.md)
* Supports a wide variety of [Comparators](Comparator.md), [Matchers](Matcher.md), [Aggregators](Aggregator.md),  [Expressions](Expressions.md),  and [Transforms](Transform.md).
* Supports [File Magic](FileMagic.md)

Tools
* [cat](cat.md) Concatenate files.
* [calc](calc.md) Solve [arithmetic](Expressions.md) equations.
* [binsearch](binsearch.md) Search in sorted files.
* [cgrep](cgrep.md) Select lines from a file, based on matching column values.
* [cut](cut.md) Select combine and rearrange parts of each line.
* [join](join.md) Join files on a matching column.
* [paste](paste.md) Join columns from multipl files.
* [sample](sample.md) Display some of the lines of a file.
* [sort](sort.md) Sort the lines of a set of input files.
* [tabs](tabs.md) Display a text file, truncated to fit the screen and with columns aligned.
* [tooltest](tooltest.md) Test command line tools.
* [transpose](transpose.md) Transpose the lines of a file.
* [uniq](uniq.md) Select only one of any set of adjacent lines.
* [verify](verify.md) Verify that file contents are correct.
* [wc](wc.md) Count words, lines and bytes of files.

The SQL query
`SELECT table1.title,table2.author from tabel1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id == table2.id WHERE tabel1.mode == "avail"` can be translated as

`cdx cgrep -p, mode,,avail table1.txt | cdx join -k id - table2.txt -o 1.title,2.author` 

or

`cdx join -k id table1.txt table2.txt -o 1.title,2.author | cdx cgrep -p, mode,,avail`
